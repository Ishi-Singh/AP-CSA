    "a. What kind of types are person1 and person2?\n",
    "  - Referance types\n",
    "b. Do person1 and person3 point to the same value in memory?\n",
    "  - Yes; person3 = person1\n",
    "c. Is the integer “number” stored in the heap or in the stack?\n",
    "  - In the stack; ints are local variables and therefore stored in a stack\n",
    "d. Is the value that “person1” points to stored in the heap or in the stack?\n",
    "  - In a heap\n",

    "Situation: You are developing a banking application where you need to represent customer information. You have decided to use both primitive types and reference types for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Define primitive types and reference types in Java. Provide examples of each.\n",
    "  - Primitive types are basic data types like ints, chars, floats, etc. and they directly store their values in memory. Reference types hold memory addresses to objects rather than the object's actual data. Some examples include classes, arrays, and interfaces (most things defined by the user)\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Explain the differences between primitive types and reference types in terms of memory allocation and usage in Java programs.\n",
    "  - Primitive types store the object's data while reference types store their values in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "c. You have a method `calculateInterest` that takes a primitive `double` type representing the principal amount and a reference type `Customer` representing the customer information. Write  the method signature and the method implementation. Include comments to explain your code."
