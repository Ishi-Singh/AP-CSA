## Projects

### Classroom Jukebox

- [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/cj_frontend)
- [Backend Repo](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/cj_backend)
- [Runtime](https://classroomjukebox.com/)

Classroom Jukebox is a web application desigened to make classrooms more interactive. It allows teachers to host music rooms where students can suggest and songs to be played during class. Some features that this project includes is the ability to create and join room, music suggestion, and approvement.

I'm dissapointed that we weren't able to make a comprehensive stats page but I was able to make a [mini-demo](https://ishi-singh.github.io/AP-CSA/2023/09/29/Spotify_Test_IPYNB_2_.html) of what I was thinking the stats page should display. Spotify has its own stats such as danceability, valence, energy, etc. and I thought that it would be interesting to expiriment with this feature.

### Sorting Mini-Project

- [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/sortsortsort)
- [Backend Repo](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/springspringspring)

This mini-project revolved around sorting algorithems such merge, bubble, and insertion sort. The way my team interpreted this is by trying to make something that helps people understand sorting algorithems. The vision we had for this project was to make something that is able to display the sorting as it progresses.

## Collegeboard Prep

### MCQ 1

- [Test Correction](https://ishi-singh.github.io/AP-CSA/2023/11/05/Collegeboard_Quiz.html)

Reflection: This was my first Collegeboard MCQ in CSA and I'm not too proud of what I got and I would attribute this low score to my limited understanding in Java. I feel like the student lessons didn't help teach Java, and rather they were just covering specific areas. I know I would have done better if I had more expirience in Java, afterall mastery comes from expirience.

### MCQ 2

- [Test Correction](https://ishi-singh.github.io/AP-CSA/2023/12/21/CollegeboardMCQ.html)

Reflection: I did better in this MCQ compared to the first one but I still lost many points becasue I overthought many of the questions. As I was doing my test corrections I realised that I knew how to do many of the questions I got wrong. Regardless, I am happier with this score and I know that I can improve which is something that motivates me to do better next time.

- [Frequently Missed Questions Lesson](https://github.com/isabelle926/II-Binary)

Isabelle and I have decided to partner up and teach questions 20 and 36. We currently don't know what we are going to do but we plan to meet and complete the lesson before this week ends. Question 20 has to do with 1D int array and nested iteration and we need to focus on speed, nested for loops, .length, and index. While question 36 has to do with iterative binary search statement execution and we need to focus on Olog(n), 2000 versus 2048, and binary search. Something I personally want to include in the lessons is how to approach those type of questions and background information on the topic being taught.

## Planning

- [CJ Github Issues](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/cj_frontend/issues)
- [Sorting Github Issues](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/sortsortsort/issues)

Overall I would say that there has been a decent amount of planning for both projects however something that I have noticed is that we plan to do too much and end up removing a feature so we can reach a deadline. This has been a somewhat reoccuring theme, and the most recent example of this is in the Classroom Jukebox project where we planned to make a stats page which displays information that has to do with the type of songs a certain class likes so the teacher can understand their class better but we had to remove this since we didn't have enough time to complete that feature.
