## Tangibles

Something that I did really well on last tri was problem solving the FRQs and explaining my thought process on how I approached and solved the problem. And I will be using all of the past Collebeboard work I've done in this class to prepare for the AP Exam, while using the advice I got during reviews to improve my weaknesses.

|2014 Practice MCQ | [Link](https://ishi-singh.github.io/AP-CSA/2023/11/05/Collegeboard_Quiz.html) |

There were also many student lessons done last tri, and I attempted to do the best I could in most of these assignments. Despite not doing as well in the tri 2 student lessons compared to the tri 1 student lessons I still plan to use the blog post to review concepts and continue using/implementing what we learned into the projects..

## Tri 3 Plans

One of our team's goals is to improve upon the project based on the advice from Night at the Museum. This includes adding more features and developing the ones that we already have. Since we have thirteen people, effective collaboration is essential to being productive. Some steps that we have taken to achieve this are creating a Discord server to have fast communication and assigning everyone to the correct roles.

We are also going to continue to have a standup meeting once a week to discuss what we are working on and how we should move forward. In the most recent meeting, we decided on our triangles and what each triangle's focus will be. My triangle (Ekam, Aiden, and I) will be working on more wireframes since the team is planning to implement parts of our new team members' projects.

A personal goal of mine this trimester is to start contributing more to the backend. After seeing how related the PBL projects we do in class are related to the Collegeboard FRQs I am more interested in starting to work with the backend or understand it better.
