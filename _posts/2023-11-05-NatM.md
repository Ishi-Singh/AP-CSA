        <p>For this one I really liked the technique used to make the painting look as if we are looking at it through a kaleidoscope. This makes the parinting look really cool and I like looking at it. I also really like the colors that were used since they make the whole piece look really realistic and the background emphasizes the subject of the painting making it look better.</p>

        <p>I liked this one because I found the overall premise of this drawing to be interesting, since it is a modern version of the painting callled Girl With the Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer. It's also really cool how the painting is able to maintain the same vibe as the original while still keeping a modern twist and this allows people to recognize that this is a modern adaptation of the famous painting.</p>

## Reflection

Overall I would say that Night at the Museum was fairly successful for the team since many people were interested to see what our project did and many people considered it to be an interesting concept. Students also really liked this idea which is a good thing since it is a website ment to cater towards students and techers. Dispite getting the main feature to work we weren't able to connect the backend and frontend for the statistics page. The idea behind it was to make a page which displays things such as popular genres and songs given the room code. But it transformed to making it display the genre and moderate (the teacher can delete any song the deem "inappropriate" and remove it from the queue). I was mainly working on the frontend so I was able to make it so that the teacher can select the song request they want to delete but this only works on the test data since it's not connected to the backend.

## Improvements

- Communicate more: I believe that I could have been a better communicater with the rest of my team since I was mainly just working on the statistics page and was unaware of what contributions my other team members were making. If I did collaborate I feel like I would have been able to make more meaningful contributions and link the backend and frontend.
- Be more active on the backend: As a frontend developer I did not make many contrubutions to the backend, which ment that I don't really understand how it works which is a problem since it polarizes the project. And I could have helped other people working on the statistics to display the correct information while getting help from them to connect the two sides.
- Being more knowledegeable in Java: something I believe contributed to me not working on the backend is that I was not confident in my Java abilities and I didn't want to make any problems that could break the website. Dispite having the student lessons I feel like the only way to truly come over this is by improving my skills and waiting over time.
